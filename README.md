# BloodLine-BloodBank Application


This project is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline the management of blood donation and transfusion services built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It facilitates the registration of blood donors, tracks blood inventory levels, and manages recipient information and transfusion requests. The project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of blood bank operations by providing features such as donor search, inventory management, and automated notifications for donation drives and urgent blood needs. It also features an admin panel for managing these resources and includes user authentication.By leveraging modern web technologies, the Blood Bank Project ensures that blood banks can maintain a reliable and safe blood supply, ultimately improving patient care and saving lives.
